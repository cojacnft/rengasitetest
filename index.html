            <p class="text-5 text-white">Out of nowhwere Rengas have become the Bored Apes of 2022. Most of us missed out and now it's too late! But before the depression sets in, this is why Renga Rave DAO was created!</p>
            <p class="text-light">60% of Secondary sales royalties, and primary mint sales will go to buying Renga on the floor and giving back to the Renga Rave DAO holders. The rest will be diverted to building more ideas to keep the future strong for the project! As sales continue to happen and royalties accumulate, every time treasury reaches a floor value, a Renga will be purchased to be given away to a holder in the community.</p>
            <p class="text-light">After mint a voting DAO will be setup in order to have the community made decisions to help shape the future of Renga Rave DAO! Voting on new projects to focus the floor on, brand new utilities, token gated holder benefits, staking, play2earn, and much more are planned for the future of the Ranga Ravers!</p>
            <p class="text-light">Check us out and become a apart of the community today!</p>

                        <p>Any failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right of these Terms and Conditions will not
                          constitute a waiver or a limit of such right.<br><br>
                          To waive any of its rights, the Company shall solely (i) expressly and (ii) in writing waive its right.</p>
